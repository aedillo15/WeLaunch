# WeLaunch
Project Overview The purpose of our project will be to create an app that will provide start-up companies with guidance and tools to facilitate the progression of their startup company. The problem our app intends to solve is the complexity and overwhelming feeling of starting a new business. We are trying to make it easier for startup companies to begin their project and have a clearer idea of what tasks they need to complete before launching.  The impact the project will have on the domain is how entrepreneurs approach the starting of a new business idea. Starting a business is an immense task, and we plan on making this process seamless, which may lead to more people trying to start their own companies using our application as a guide.  The project plan we have in place right now is very feasible in terms of the code and the requirements we plan on implementing, however, one limitation that we have is time, as this project has to be completed before the end of the school term. If this was a real-world project that a company was commissioning, we think that it is 100% feasible. However, due to our time constraints, we believe it is a possibility that we run out of time before successfully implementing all planned functionalities.
